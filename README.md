# Max & Ruby: Back-end

This project is the back-end of my Max & Ruby full-stack fan app. The stack used for this app
includes Angular for the front-end, Spring for the back-end, and MySQL for the database of
characters and episodes. My app will only focus on the characters and episodes in Seasons 1-5 of
the series because in those episodes, Max only says a word or two for each time he speaks.

Max & Ruby characters and concept originally created by Rosemary Wells. The Max & Ruby cartoon
series, based on the books by Wells, was originally produced by Nelvana Ltd. in Canada in 2002-2019
and aired in the U.S. on Nick Jr.

This project was generated with the Spring Boot CLI.
